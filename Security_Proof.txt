Key-Derivation and Key must be known and must be calculated to change Data, Detect [Encryption can not be Detected (indistinguishable from Random Data)], or Read Data from File 

Known Variables
 -Salt for Key Deriv func
 -Hash of Key Deriv func
 -HMAC
 -IV
 -ENC_File

Unknown Variables
 -Key ?
 -Deriv_Key

The IV and Salt are Random by default HMAC is like the Hash and ENC_File Cryptographic Random with reference to Deriv_Key.
This means what "Key" must be known and derived to Deriv_Key to Change, Detect or Read the Encrypted Data.  

(Paddinglength and Padding is Encrypted with File)
